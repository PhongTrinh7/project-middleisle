  description1: '"Lind is rallying his followers at the Bay Building right now, which
    means it''s probably not long until they''re at the doors to the North Wing.
    I need to get into his office before they burn the whole place to the ground.
    I''m going to record all my notes on magnetic tape once I''m in there, so hopefully
    it''ll be fast enough that I can get in and get out before they find me."'
