  description1: "From Aleksander\u2019s Notes:"
  description2: 'A sun idol carved from the tusk of a walrus, with eyes and ornamentation
    carved of oak and set into the tusk with  coal pitch.  '
  description3: Thought to be the result of syncretism    between Nordic and Lithuanian
    peoples  on Brinnestadt circa 1150 AD. The runes on the tusk are Nordic in origin,
    and are not currently translatable.
  description4: Representative Lind likely came into      posession of this piece
    during his exile throughout the second Great War. It is   yet another example
    of his fixation on Norse Paganism, and ought to be in a museum, not his personal
    collection.
