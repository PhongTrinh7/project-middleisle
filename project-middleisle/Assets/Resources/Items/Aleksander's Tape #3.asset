  description1: "\u201CShit! Lind\u2019s office records are locked behind a code\u2026
    probably commissioned special. Nordic Runes\u2026 of course. The man is as predictable
    as he is paranoid. I think I might know\u2026 but there\u2019s no way I can get
    to it now\u2026 Okay, to anyone who finds this, My name is Aleksander Ekdahl.
    I\u2019m a journalist and a publisher, and I know that Mikael Lind is hiding
    something important behind this door. The solution will be in the Gallery. It
    has to be. Find it. If you know me, then you know where I\u2019ll be when you
    have it.\u201D "
